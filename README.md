## 🚀 About Me
I am an MBA (Finance) graduate passionate about building analyst-grade financial models and conducting deep fundamental research across sectors. I focus on translating financial statements into structured valuation frameworks that explain why a business is worth what it is.

I am currently building projects under **Aurex Research**, a personal initiative for financial education, analytics, and long-term market insights across India and the U.S.

## 📂 Featured Projects

### 🔹 Auto Sector – Driver-Based DCF Valuation Model
A fully integrated 3-statement FCFF DCF model for an Indian auto major with:

- Driver-based forecasting for growth, margins, capex & working capital  
- Dynamic WACC build-up  
- Sensitivity (WACC × g) heatmap  
- Multi-variable stress testing  
- Interactive output dashboard with scenario analysis

### 🔹 FMCG ROCE Compounding Model – HUL vs ITC
A ROCE-driven compounding framework analyzing two Indian FMCG leaders to understand how capital efficiency converts into cash flows and intrinsic value:

- Driver-based revenue, margin & reinvestment modeling  
- Integrated ROCE → FCFF → DCF valuation flow  
- Capital employed build-up with working capital & PPE logic  
- Sensitivity and scenario stress testing  
- One-page premium output dashboard  
- Robust internal **Checks** for auditability  
- Terminal value share optimized (~75–80% of EV)

### 🔹 LBO + DCF Transaction Model (IT Services Case)
This framework complements traditional DCF analysis by adding a private equity lens — focusing on capital structure, debt paydown, and exit value creation, without making any investment recommendations.

Key features:

- Entry valuation snapshot (EV, EBITDA, entry multiple)
- Capital structure & funding mix (Debt vs Equity)
- Debt schedule with cash sweep and paydown logic
- Exit valuation using EV/EBITDA multiple
- Equity bridge from entry to exit (waterfall)
- Returns analysis: MOIC & Equity IRR
- Scenario-driven assumptions (holding period, leverage, cost of debt, fees)
- Integrated Transaction Summary Dashboard with charts
- Designed to be fully compatible with the underlying operating & DCF model

### 🔹 Valuation Dashboard - Deterministic & Probabilistic View
An Excel-based operating-driver valuation model with Monte Carlo simulation, designed to evaluate intrinsic value through ranges and probabilities rather than point estimates.

Key features:

- Operating model linking growth, profitability, reinvestment, and FCFF
- Explicit focus on economic value drivers instead of accounting statements
- Monte Carlo simulation to model uncertainty across key assumptions
- Percentile-based WACC × g sensitivity surface built from simulated outcomes
- Clean, analyst-grade Output Dashboard summarizing risk, dispersion, and valuation robustness

The project highlights probabilistic thinking and valuation fragility, offering a structured approach to understanding long-term value under uncertainty.
